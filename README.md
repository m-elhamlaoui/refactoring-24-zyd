# Belote Tournament Management Project

## Project Issues and Critiques

Below is an expanded analysis of problems related to each part of the Belote tournament management project, focusing on software engineering aspects. Each issue is explained in detail, indicating where in the code (which file and location) the problem exists, and providing context to help you understand and address it.

### 1. Database Management

#### Issue: Hardcoded Database Credentials in Code
- **Problem Explanation**:
  - Security Risk: Hardcoding database credentials directly into the source code exposes sensitive information to anyone with access to the code, creating a significant security vulnerability.
  - Maintenance Difficulty: Changing credentials requires modifying and recompiling the code, which is inefficient.
  - Lack of Flexibility: It is difficult to manage different credentials for different environments (development, testing, production).

- **Where in the Code**:  
  - **File**: `Belote.java`  
  - **Location**: In the main method, when establishing the database connection.

- **Explanation**:  
  The hardcoded username and password should be replaced with variables loaded from a secure configuration file or environment variables.

#### Issue: No External Configuration for Database Settings
- **Problem Explanation**:
  - Inflexibility: Embedding database connection details directly in the code makes configuration changes more complex and error-prone.
  - Deployment Challenges: Different environments may require different database settings, making deployment harder.

- **Where in the Code**:  
  - **File**: `Belote.java`  
  - **Location**: In the main method, when connecting to the database.

- **Explanation**:  
  The hardcoded database URL and credentials reduce flexibility. These settings should be externalized in a configuration file or environment variables.

#### Issue: Platform-Specific File Paths
- **Problem Explanation**:
  - Cross-Platform Issues: Using platform-specific environment variables and file separators limits compatibility with different operating systems like macOS or Linux.
  - Portability: These practices limit the application's ability to run in different environments.

- **Where in the Code**:  
  - **File**: `Belote.java`  
  - **Location**: In the main method, where the database path is set.
